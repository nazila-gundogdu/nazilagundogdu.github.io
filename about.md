I am Nazila Gundogdu (Shafiei), with a Ph.D. in Computational Linguistics from Stony Brook University, and over 4 years of industry experience as a Language Engineer in Amazon Alexa. 

I finished my doctoral studies in 2022, with a focus on theoretical and computational syntax, giving me various ways to find out how these different avenues can inform our understanding of syntactic phenomena, and how they can be tied together. During my Ph.D. program, I have had the opportunity to [present]() and [publish]() my research in various places.

Despite that, I was able to climb up the ladders and get promoted to an L5 within the first 1.5 years, and later to the team lead. During my tenure in Amazon, I have shipped numerous [features](), and took the initiative to reduce our domain's friction rate by over 20%.

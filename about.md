I am Nazila Gundogdu (Shafiei), with a Ph.D. in Computational Linguistics from Stony Brook Univerisy, and over 4 years of industry experience as a Language Engineer in Amazon Alexa. 

I finished my doctoral studies in 2022, with a focus on theoretical and computational syntax, giving me various ways to find out how these different avenues can inform our understanding of syntactic phenomena, and how they can be tied together. During my Ph.D. program, I have had the opportunity to [present]() and [publish](publications) my research in various places.

Besides research and academia, my fascination with Machine Learning and Natural Langauge Processing led me seek a position in the leading company for voice activated devices, i.e. Amazon. I have been working as a Language Engineer for Alexa Personal Mobility NLU team, where I can apply my linguistic knowledge in real world applications, and contribute to Alexa's understanding of human commands. 

Feel free to contact me to discuss linguistics and/or talk about how fun Alexa is.

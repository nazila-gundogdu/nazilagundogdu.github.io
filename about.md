I am Nazila Shafiei, a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in [Linguistics at Stony Brook University](https://linguistics.stonybrook.edu). I am also a Language Engineer for Amazon Alexa, which I joined in May 2020. 

My research operates at the intersection of theoretical and computational syntax, giving me various ways to find out how these different avenues can inform our understanding of syntactic phenomena, and how they can be tied together. My theoretical work has been on subjects such as ellipsis, quantifier and negation scope, and wh-questions in Persian. Some of these subjects, e.g. negation scope and wh-questions, have been a focus of behavioral experiments conducted in my previous and current institutions. Additionally, being influenced by the works of [Jeffrey Heinz](http://jeffreyheinz.net/) and [Thomas Graf](https://thomasgraf.net/) on subregular hierarchy, the focus of my computational research is on investigating the complexity of various syntactic operations, in particular syntactic long-distance dependencies such as binding, NPI licensing and movement constraints. 

My fascination with Machine Learning and Natural Langauge Processing led me seek a position in the leading company for voice activated devices, i.e. Amazon. I have been working as a Language Engineer for Alexa Personal Mobility NLU team, where I can apply my linguistic knowledge in real world applications, and contribute to Alexa's understanding of human commands. 

Feel free to contact me to discuss linguistics and/or talk about how fun Alexa is.
